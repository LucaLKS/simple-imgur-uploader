As the name suggests, a simple script that uploads anonymously to imgur. The URL of the image gets copied directly into the user's clipboard.
I made this script while learning python.  
It uses the [Pyperclip](https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip "Pyperclip GitHub") and [Requests](.python-requests.org/ "Requests website") modules.

#### To-Do List:
* ~~Pass directory as an argument~~
* Upload from URL
* GUI interface
  - Drag and drop
